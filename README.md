# NeopetsUserscripts
A selection of random userscripts I wrote for Neopets. 

Disclaimer: I'm a Java dev by trade. If my JS coding style is atrocious... I'm sorry.

## Scripts:

### Fierce Peophins
What do you do if fierce peophins has eaten too much tin of olives? Who cares, but this script will automatically fill this question in for you when you go to the grumpy old king.

### Vending Machine Randomizer
Why are there so many pointless drop-downs to fill in at the Neocola and Nerkmid vending machines? This script will randomly pick some options for you.

### SDB Better Item Removal
Improves the UI for removing items in your SDB by adding:
* buttons for +1, +5, or +all below the removal text box, so you don't have to manually type it in
* a "Remove all items" button which will max out the removal text box for every item from the current SDB page


## TODO - Future script ideas

### Lunar Temple Solver
This will automatically calculate the correct display angle at the Shenkuu Lunar Temple and highlight which moon phase you should click on.

### Jokes & Wisdom Randomizer
Same as the vending machine script, this will pick some random options for you at the Grumpy Old King and the Wise Old King so you don't have to randomly pick them yourself.

Have ideas for other scripts but don't know how to write them yourself? Want to complain about my javascript code (or, god forbid, provide constructive feedback)? Shoot me an email at chaiinchomp@gmail.com.
