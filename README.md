# NeopetsUserscripts

A selection of Neopets UI improvement userscripts.

## Scripts:

### SDB Better Item Removal

Improves the UI for removing items in your SDB by adding:

- buttons for +1, +5, or +all below the removal text box, so you don't have to manually type it in
- a "Remove all items" button which will max out the removal text box for every item from the current SDB page
- another button at the bottom to add +1 to every item on the page

### Fierce Peophins

What do you do if fierce peophins has eaten too much tin of olives? Who knows, but this script will automatically fill this question in for you when you go to the grumpy old king.

### Vending Machine Randomizer

Neocola and Nerkmid vending machines have a lot of options, but none of them matter. This script will randomly pick some options for you.
